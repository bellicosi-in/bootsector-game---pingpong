THE BOOT PROCESS

1. when we rebot our comptuer it must start up again initially without any notioin of an operating system.
2. it must load the os from some permanent storage device that is currently attached to the computer.
3. at the boot up, we only have BIOS( Basic Input Output Software),a collection of software routines that
are initially loaded from a chip into memory and initialised when the computer is switched on.
4. after the bios completes some low level tests of the hardware ,whether the isntalled memory is working 
correctly, it must boot the operating system.
5. since the BIOS cannot read the files or such, it must read from a specific sector of the memory/physical 
location of the disk devices. the easiest place for BIOS to find the OS is in the first sector
of one of the disks known as the boot sector.
6. to idenitfy the boot sector of a block, the last two bytes must be 0x55 and 0xaa, which tells BIOS that 
this is a boot block.
